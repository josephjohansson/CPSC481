Axure Wireframe Prototype Readme

The wireframe prototype for the CTIS system is a model of the CTRAIN 
existing kiosks with our added features for RFID card capabilities.

You can still use the kiosk to buy printed tickets, as is the status
quo, but you can also choose to swipe your RFID card to quickly pay.

The new feature shown in this wireframe prototype is modifying your 
account to choose WHAT you are paying for each time you swipe,
whether it's a single ticket, daily pass, or monthly pass.

This prototype shows the general layout of the new system, while 
staying true to the existing system to avoid confusion with 
existing clients.
